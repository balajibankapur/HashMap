1. HashMap can constructed with given size.

2. Provides insert, remove and lookup functionality.

3. HashMap supports generic key-value pair

4. HashMap class supports synchronization with following features,
    a. Bucket index based locking. i.e. one mutex per bucket index.
    b. Supports multiple writers at the same time if the writers are inserting to different bucket index
    c. std::mutex is used as a synchronization primitive for lookup, insert and remove.
		 (pthreads read_write locks can be used instead of std::mutex, which is optimized in terms
		 of simultaneous reads). 
		 Used simple mutex because, 
	     1. read write locks are more expensive than simple mutex and 
		 2. given requirements is to support only multiple writers at the same time.
